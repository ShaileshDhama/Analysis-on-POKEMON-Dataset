# This repo contains all the analysis I've performed using the Pokemon dataset

The Pokemon dataset is a listing of all Pokemon species as of mid-2016, containing data about their type and statistics. Considering how diverse Pokemon are, I was interested in analyzing this datset to learn how the game is balanced and to potentially identify the best Pokemon, if there exists one.
